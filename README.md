## 1. Project Overview

The Asset & Equipment Management System is a business-oriented system designed to help organizations manage company-owned assets and equipment in a centralized and structured manner.

The system aims to replace manual asset tracking methods such as Excel spreadsheets and paper records by providing a digital solution that improves data accuracy, transparency, and operational efficiency.

This project focuses on business analysis, system modeling, data design, and UI prototyping to demonstrate a complete end-to-end analysis process.

**Project Description**

The Asset & Equipment Management System project was initiated to analyze and design a centralized system that supports organizations in managing physical assets and equipment throughout their lifecycle.

The project covers the full business analysis process, from understanding the business problem and defining system requirements to modeling the system structure and visualizing user interaction through wireframes and prototypes.

Key aspects of the project include:
- Analysis of current manual asset management processes
- Identification of business pain points and improvement opportunities
- Definition of functional and non-functional requirements
- Design of a logical database structure to support asset tracking
- Creation of UI wireframes and clickable prototypes to validate requirements and user flows

The project is designed as a business-driven case study, focusing on how a Business Analyst translates business needs into system requirements and visual representations that can be handed over to development teams.

This system provides a foundation that can be further extended into a fully implemented asset management application in future phases.

## 2. Business Context

Many small and medium-sized organizations manage assets and equipment manually. Common challenges include:

- Fragmented asset data stored across spreadsheets
- Difficulty tracking asset usage and status
- Lack of visibility into asset lifecycle and depreciation
- Time-consuming and error-prone reporting

As asset quantity increases, manual processes become inefficient and difficult to scale. A centralized asset management system is required to support better control and decision-making.

---

## 3. Problem Statement

The current asset management approach presents several issues:

- High dependency on manual data entry
- No real-time visibility into asset status
- Difficulty tracking asset lifecycle and depreciation
- Increased risk of data inconsistency or asset loss
- Limited reporting capability

These issues negatively impact operational efficiency and asset governance.

## 4. Project Objectives

The objectives of this project are to:

- Centralize asset and equipment information
- Track asset status and lifecycle
- Support depreciation monitoring
- Improve data accuracy and consistency
- Provide a foundation for future system implementation

---

## 5. Project Scope

### 5.1 In Scope
- Asset and equipment information management
- Department-based asset tracking
- Asset status monitoring
- Purchase date and depreciation tracking
- Basic asset reporting
- UI wireframe and prototype design

### 5.2 Out of Scope
- Financial accounting and taxation
- Human resource management
- Maintenance scheduling
- ERP or third-party system integration
- Production-level system deployment

## 6. Stakeholders

| Stakeholder | Responsibility |
|-----------|---------------|
| Business Owner | Asset oversight and decision-making |
| Department Manager | Asset allocation and usage |
| Operational Staff | Asset utilization |
| Business Analyst | Requirement analysis, system design, and prototyping |

---

## 7. System Design Overview

The system is designed around key business entities:

- Asset
- Equipment
- Department
- Asset Status
- Depreciation Information

The design ensures clear relationships between entities, data integrity, and scalability for future enhancements.

---

## 8. Database Design

The database follows a relational design approach to support asset management operations.

Core tables include:
- Assets
- Equipment
- Departments
- Depreciation Records

SQL scripts are provided to demonstrate table structures and relationships.

---

## 9. UI / UX Prototype

The UI/UX prototype was created to visualize system requirements and validate user flows with stakeholders.

### Wireframes
- Low-fidelity wireframes illustrate screen layout and functional elements.
- Focus on usability and information structure.

### Clickable Prototype
- High-fidelity prototype demonstrates key user flows:
  - Asset creation
  - Asset update
  - Asset status tracking
  - Asset listing by department

## 10. Assumptions & Constraints

### Assumptions
- The organization operates at a small-to-medium scale
- Users have basic knowledge of asset management
- The system is used internally for management purposes

### Constraints
- No backend or frontend implementation in this phase
- The project focuses on analysis, design, and prototyping
- No integration with external systems

## 11. Documentation

This repository includes the following business analysis artifacts:

- Business context and problem definition
- System scope and requirement overview
- Database design (SQL)
- UI wireframes and clickable prototype
- Supporting diagrams and documentation

---

## 12. Notes

This project demonstrates a structured approach to:

- Business problem analysis
- Requirement definition
- System and data modeling
- UI/UX prototyping

The project is designed as a **business analysis case study** rather than a fully implemented software product.
